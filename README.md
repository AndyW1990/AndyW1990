### Hello! 👋

I'm Andy, a former Naval Architect with a passion for computer science and machine learning.

I have been using Python for about 6 years in my old role, and completed some online courses in machine learning over the years.

I recently decided to make the career change, first completing a 9-week Data Science bootcamp at Le Wagon, London.

My current interest is reinforcement learning which I used for my [final project](https://github.com/AndyW1990/rl-control) at Le Wagon. If anyone is interested I made a lockdown "curriculum" to learn RL from online sources back in 2020. 

You can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/awhitworth1990).

- 2021 - Course Rinforcement Learning, David Silver UCL (among other great resources - ask me for my lockdown curriculum!)
- 2020 - Deep Learning Specialization (5 courses), DeepLearning.AI
- 2019 - Chartered Engineering CEng status, RINA
- 2018 - Machine Learning, Stanford University Online
- 2014 - Naval Architecture BEng, Newcastle University
