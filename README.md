### Hello! 👋

I'm Andy, I recently completed a Data Science course at Le Wagon, London. I have always been passionate about tech and discovered machine learning during my previous role as a Naval Architect when using Python to streamline processes across engineering tasks.

I spend 10 years at a marine consultancy and was exposed to a great veriety of design and analysis projects. I finally decided to switch careers after completing a few online courses in machine and deep learning. Le Wagon's data science bootcamp was the final piece of the puzzle and hopefully my gateway into the tech industry.

My current interest is reinforcement learning which I used for my [final project](https://github.com/AndyW1990/rl-control) at Le Wagon. If anyone is interested I made a lockdown "curriculum" to learn RL from online sources back in 2020.

I recently completed a Data Science course at Le Wagon, London. I have always been passionate about tech and discovered machine learning during my previous role as a Naval Architect when using Python to streamline processes across engineering tasks.

I gained valuable experience in project and stakeholder management during a 10 year career as a naval architect and became a chartered engineer in 2019. For the past 6 years I have been teaching myself Python, which I have used in many interesting projects, such as: 
- Developing a package to use vessel motions data to produce calculations and reports
- Utilising Python APIs with engineering simulation software to setup, run and extract data for post-processing and presentation

I finally decided to switch careers after completing a few online courses in machine and deep learning, following that up with various online resources to teach myself reinforcement learning, which I am highly interested in. Le Wagon's data science bootcamp was the final piece of the puzzle and hopefully my gateway into the tech industry.





I love to learn new things and constantly strive to know more. Here's a list of relavent studies:
- 2023 - Data Science & AI Course, Le Wagon, London
- 2021 - Course Rinforcement Learning, David Silver UCL (among other great resources - ask me for my lockdown curriculum!)
- 2020 - Deep Learning Specialization (5 courses), DeepLearning.AI
- 2019 - Chartered Engineering CEng status, RINA
- 2018 - Machine Learning, Stanford University Online
- 2014 - Naval Architecture BEng, Newcastle University
