### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andy, a former Naval Architect with a passion for computer programming and machine learning.

I have been using Python for about 6 years in my old role, and completed some online courses in machine learning over the years.

I recently decided to make the career change, first completing a 9-week Data Science bootcamp at Le Wagon, London.

My current interest is reinforcement learning which I used for my [final project](https://github.com/AndyW1990/rl-control) at Le Wagon. If anyone is interested I made a lockdown "curriculum" to learn RL from online sources back in 2020. 

You can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/awhitworth1990).
